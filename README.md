# Introducing MzeeStagram 🔥
  An Instagram clone built by someone named Mzee(me btw). 😆
  
## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to build a React app using a nosql backend (firebase). This project has allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of the fundamentals/basics and the intermediate aspects of React. Whilst gaining an understanding on hooks such as useMemo which can help the boost the performance of React apps. In this application I also made use of local storage to help persist users sessions even after browser refreshes to allow for a better user experience. I also took advantage of the context API to easily share state around the app and to avoid prop drilling.

## Features
  * Standard authentication functionality (signup and signin) ✔️.
  * The ability to comment on and like other peoples posts ✔️.
  * The ability to follow and unfollow users ✔️.
  * State managed throught context API ✔️.
  * Written in modern React with functional components and hooks ✔️.
  * Persisted with a firebase backend ✔️.

## RoadMap
  * The ability for users to post images. As its not an instagram clone if you can't post images 🤦‍♂️.
  * Write some tests for the React components as tests are good 🧪. 
      * Based on the above learn to write test for React components 🙂.
